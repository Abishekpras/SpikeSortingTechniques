Lets say you're at a noisy crowded party. Would you be able to tell a person's voice different from that of another's? How complex can it get with added noise contribution from the other party attendees? If its difficult for us humans to perceive it, then how good do you think an Artificially Intelligent agent can perform? To complicate the problem a little more, translate this same problem to neurons or nerve cells communicating inside of our body. Can you tell one neuron's activity apart from that of another's? What are some of the principles of Artificial Intelligence that is helping it revolutionize problems in traditional signal processing? Check out the report to know more.
